## Running Locally

1. In the terminal run the command `npm install` to install all necessary packages
2. Run the command `npm run dev` and click on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Seed The DB

As the auth library we use requires that NextJS be running in order to seed new users, the following steps are needed
to seed the database.

1. Go to src/app/page.tsx
2. Uncomment out the function seed(). This will seed the database
3. In the terminal run the command `npm run dev` and click on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
4. Wait until you see 'Done Seeding Database' in the terminal and then click 'CTRL C' to stop the site from running.
5. Go back to src/app/page.tsx and comment out the function seed().
6. In the terminal run the command `npm run dev` and click on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) again and will be
   able to run the site with the seeded database.

## Docker

Run `docker compose up --build` to start running the NextJS application, socket server, and MongoDB containers
simultaneously. After that, everything should work like if you were developing locally.
